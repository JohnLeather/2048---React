![2048 game](document-images/Screenshot.png)
This is my first ReactJS project and took a couple of days to code while reading the basic of React during development.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
